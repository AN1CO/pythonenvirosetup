# Set up Environment for Python on Mac#

#### You only have to do this once! ####

In the terminal:

######Step 1######
`brew install python3`

this installs a new clean copy of Python 3 so it doesn't interfere with any Python that might be used on your system.

######Step 2######
`brew install tree`

this helps make file trees look prettier in the terminal. Will help in the future. For more about tree commands click here.

######Step 3######
Once Python 3 is installed:
`pip3 install ipython

iPython is like Ruby's irb. The terminal repl that ships with Python

######Step 4######
`pip3 install virtualenv`
`pip3 install virtualenvwrapper`

This will help create a virtual environment for your Python.

######Step 5######
After installing everything, type this in your terminal:

`atom ~/.bash_profile`

if you don't have a bash profile file yet:
`touch ~/.bash_profile`

then open it up in Atom or whatever your preferred text editor is.
